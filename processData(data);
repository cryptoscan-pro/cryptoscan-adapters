## Security

- Only requests from whitelisted IPs (specified in your project configuration) are processed
- Each project can only send data for its specified type
- All data must include a unique key for identification

## Data Types

The service currently supports these data types:
- `networks`: Network information
- `cex-listings`: Centralized exchange listings
- `dex-listings`: Decentralized exchange listings
- `prices`: Price updates
- `liquidations`: Liquidation events
- `arbitrage`: Arbitrage opportunities
- `cex-announcements`: Exchange announcements

## Development Mode

When `NODE_ENV` is set to "development", IP verification is disabled for testing purposes.

## Error Handling

The service will:
- Validate incoming data format
- Ensure all required fields are present
- Convert string numbers to actual number types
- Return error messages for invalid data
