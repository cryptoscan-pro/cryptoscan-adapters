4. **Deploy your adapter**: Once you've implemented your adapter, deploy it to a server with a public IP address. Make sure to whitelist this IP address in the `provider.ip` field of your adapter configuration.

That's it! Your adapter is now integrated with the Cryptoscan platform, and your data will be processed and stored in the Cryptoscan database.

## Adapter Guidelines

- **Unique project type**: Ensure that the `type` field in your adapter configuration is unique across all projects.
- **Whitelisted IP**: The `provider.ip` field should be set to the public IP address of the server hosting your adapter. This IP will be whitelisted to receive data from your project.
- **Data transformation**: The `handler` function should transform the incoming data into the format expected by Cryptoscan. This includes setting the `key` field to a unique identifier for the data point, and the `price` field to the appropriate value.
- **Error handling**: Ensure that your adapter handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful error messages to the Cryptoscan platform.
- **Documentation**: Update this README file with any additional information or instructions specific to your adapter.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your adapter integrates seamlessly with the Cryptoscan platform and provides a reliable and consistent data feed.
