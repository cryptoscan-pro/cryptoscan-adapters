The adapter will receive the data, process it through your handler function, and forward the transformed data to the Cryptoscan system.

## Adapter Functionality

The adapter has the following responsibilities:

1. **Load project definitions**: The adapter loads all project definitions from the `src/projects` directory and creates a list of trigger functions.

2. **Handle WebSocket connections**: The adapter listens for WebSocket connections and processes incoming messages.

3. **Invoke project handlers**: For each incoming message, the adapter checks the "type" field and invokes the corresponding project handler. The handler function is responsible for transforming the data into the required format.

4. **Forward processed data**: After the data is processed by the project handler, the adapter forwards the transformed data to the Cryptoscan system.
